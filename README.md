> Reebot is a robot I made when I was 10-11 years old in order to participate to the robotics contest of French Guiana. It was made with mBlock software and a MBot base. 

# What are its functionalities?
It has three main functions which are, on the one hand, the aesthetics of the robot, as the contest included a trophy for the most beautiful robot, on the other hand, to be able to get out of a random maze, thanks to a method based on the line follower, as well as sumo, having for objective to knock down an opponent robot, in an autonomous way.

# Why publish it on GitHub?
I finally decided to publish it open source on GitHub, because I stopped developing robots with visual programming languages (now using tools like ROS & C++), that it was a rather interesting project to develop, that its source code could help anyone to develop his own robot, as well as by its modeling.

**On the other hand, I personally do not authorize, in any case to use this source code as a basis to participate in competitions such as the one I participated in, or others like the RobotRAVE. Thank you for your understanding and your agreement.**
